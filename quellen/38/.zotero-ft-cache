HTML and XHTML
❮ Previous Next ❯

XHTML is HTML written as XML.
What Is XHTML?

    XHTML stands for E X tensible H yper T ext M arkup L anguage
    XHTML is almost identical to HTML
    XHTML is stricter than HTML
    XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
    XHTML is supported by all major browsers

Why XHTML?

Many pages on the internet contain "bad" HTML.

This HTML code works fine in most browsers (even if it does not follow the HTML rules):
<html>
<head>
  <title>This is bad HTML</title>

<body>
  <h1>Bad HTML
  <p>This is a paragraph
</body>

Today's market consists of different browser technologies. Some browsers run on computers, and some browsers run on mobile phones or other small devices. Smaller devices often lack the resources or power to interpret "bad" markup.

XML is a markup language where documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

If you want to study XML, please read our XML tutorial .

XHTML was developed by combining the strengths of HTML and XML.

XHTML is HTML redesigned as XML.
The Most Important Differences from HTML:
Document Structure

    XHTML DOCTYPE is mandatory
    The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
    <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory

XHTML Elements

    XHTML elements must be properly nested
    XHTML elements must always be closed
    XHTML elements must be in lowercase
    XHTML documents must have one root element

XHTML Attributes

    Attribute names must be in lower case
    Attribute values must be quoted
    Attribute minimization is forbidden

<!DOCTYPE ....> Is Mandatory

An XHTML document must have an XHTML DOCTYPE declaration.

A complete list of all the XHTML Doctypes is found in our HTML Tags Reference.

The <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present, and the xmlns attribute in <html> must specify the xml namespace for the document.

This example shows an XHTML document with a minimum of required tags:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<head>
  <title>Title of document</title>
</head>

<body>
  some content
</body>

</html>
XHTML Elements Must Be Properly Nested

In HTML, some elements can be improperly nested within each other, like this:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</b></i>

In XHTML, all elements must be properly nested within each other, like this:
<b><i>This text is bold and italic</i></b>
XHTML Elements Must Always Be Closed

This is wrong:
<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is another paragraph

This is correct:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p>This is another paragraph</p>
Empty Elements Must Also Be Closed

This is wrong:
A break: <br>
A horizontal rule: <hr>
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face">

This is correct:
A break: <br />
A horizontal rule: <hr />
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face" />
XHTML Elements Must Be In Lower Case

This is wrong:
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph</P>
</BODY>

This is correct:
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
XHTML Attribute Names Must Be In Lower Case

This is wrong:
<table WIDTH="100%">

This is correct:
<table width="100%">
Attribute Values Must Be Quoted

This is wrong:
<table width=100%>

This is correct:
<table width="100%">
Attribute Minimization Is Forbidden

Wrong:
<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" checked />

Correct:
<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" checked="checked" />

Wrong:
<input type="text" name="lastname" disabled />

Correct:
<input type="text" name="lastname" disabled="disabled" />
How to Convert from HTML to XHTML

    Add an XHTML <!DOCTYPE> to the first line of every page
    Add an xmlns attribute to the html element of every page
    Change all element names to lowercase
    Close all empty elements
    Change all attribute names to lowercase
