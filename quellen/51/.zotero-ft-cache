OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop and embedded systems for use with the JDK. It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications. This is the open source project where we develop JavaFX.

OpenJFX is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License with Classpath Exception , just like the JDK Project. Anybody is welcome to contribute to this project, port it to other platforms or devices, or do anything else that a free software license allows you to do! We welcome patches and involvement from individual contributors or companies. See the Community section of this WIki and the OpenJDK How to Contribute page for details on how you can become a contributor.

The OpenJFX Project is part of the OpenJDK open-source Community. The OpenJDK Bylaws and License govern our work. The OpenJFX project membership can be found on the OpenJDK Census .
