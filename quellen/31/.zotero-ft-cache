Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a markup language for declarative application programming. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) implements aXAML processor implementation, and provides XAML language support. The WPF types are implemented such that they can provide the required type backing for a XAML representation. In general, you can create the majority of your WPF application UI in XAML markup.
