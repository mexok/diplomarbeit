Why CLion
A power tool
For a power language
Smart C and C++ editor

Thanks to native C and C++ support, including modern C++ standards, libc++ and Boost, CLion knows your code through and through and takes care of the routine while you focus on the important things.
Navigation

Instantly navigate to a symbol's declaration or context usages, search through the whole project for a class, file or symbol by its name, find your way through the code base with structure and hierarchical views.
Code generation

Add class members, override/implement functions, generate constructors/destructors, getters/setters, equality, relational and stream output operators, wrap a block of code with a statement, or generate a declaration from actual usage - all via simple keyboard shortcuts.
Refactoring

Rename symbols, move members up/down the hierarchy, change function signature, and be sure CLion’s automated refactorings will accurately propagate the appropriate changes throughout your code.

On-the-fly
code analysis
Code Analysis

With CLion, you can create code that's beautiful and correct at the same time. Potential code issues are identified instantly...
Code Analysis

...and fixed as you type! Be sure all the proper changes are handled automatically by CLion.
Code Analysis

CLion also performs Data Flow analysis to find out all the cases of the unreachable code, infinite recursion and more.
Integrated debugger

Investigate and solve problems with ease through CLion's friendly debugger user interface with GDB or LLDB available as a backend.

Attach to local processes or debug remotely. Check disassembly view when sources are not available.
Inline variable view

Get the complete view of your project with variable values shown right in the editor as you debug.
Watches and variables view

Inspect the state of all the variable for a chosen function in the stack frame, or monitor variable/expression changes during the debug session.
Watch demo
Evaluate expression

Evaluate result of a function call or some complicated expression when stop at some execution point in the debug session.
Fully Integrated C/C++ Development Environment
CMake

Using CMake as a project model, CLion handles your changes in CMake files automatically, using all the information from there during code editing and refactorings.
Embedded terminal

Run any command without leaving the IDE: locally or remotely using the SSH protocol. Depending on your platform, you can work with a command line prompt, Far, powershell, bash, or other tools.
The complete experience

Popular VCS supported out of the box include Subversion, Git, GitHub, Mercurial, CVS, Perforce (via plugin), and TFS.

CLion also seamlessly integrates with Google Test, Boost.Test and Catch frameworks, supports Doxygen and Database tools.
Keyboard-centric approach

To help you focus on code and raise your productivity, CLion has keyboard shortcuts for nearly all its features, actions and commands.

Vim fans are welcome to install the Vim-emulation plugin .

    Prof. Dr. Rodriguez-Losada,
    biicode CTO
    CLion is fantastic, finally the C++ high quality cross-platform IDE with CMake as first class build system we were waiting for. 

    A product that was impressive during the EAP versions. I’m looking forward to seeing where JetBrains will take it from here. Considering the quality of their other products the sky is the limit.

    I would like to take this moment to say, CLion has quickly become my favorite IDE for C/C++. It just works. #jetbrains #CLion 

    Really liking @clion_ide for a new C++ project: lightweight, responsive, useful, good integrations. And most important, great vi emulation.
